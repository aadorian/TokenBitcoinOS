# NFTCharm

## Installation

To install the charms package, run the following command:

```bash
cargo install charms --version=0.10.0
```

This will install version 0.10.0 of the charms package using Cargo, Rust's package manager.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. If you don't have them installed, you can get them from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

## Creating a New Token Project

After installing charms, you can create a new token project using:

```bash
charms app new my-token
```

This command will:
- Create a new directory called `my-token`
- Generate a new Charms application with the necessary project structure
- Set up the boilerplate code for your token project
- Initialize configuration files needed for token development

Replace `my-token` with your desired project name.
